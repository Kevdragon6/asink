Checking Out The Code
==================

$ git clone git://github.com/aclindsa/asink.git


How To Run The Asink Server
===========================

1. Make sure you have the installation requirements met:

Server Installation requirements:
- python v2.7
- sqlite3
- Tornado and its dependencies (python-pycurl). Available at http://www.tornadoweb.org/.

2. Change directories into the source you checked out above:
$ cd asink/src/server/

3. Run the server:
$ ./start.py


How To Install Asink Client
===========================

1. Make sure you have the installation requirements met:

Client Installation requirements:
- python v2.7
- pyinotify
- sqlite3
Additional requirement to run profiling (not required unless you want to profile the execution of the code):
- yappi (http://code.google.com/p/yappi/)

2. Install the client database and ~/.asink directory
$ cd asink/src/client/
$ ./install.py

3. Customize your ~/.asink/config.cfg to add the options you need. Its probably a good idea to start with one of the following (depending on your storage mechanism):

Example S3 Configuration (requires Amazon S3 account and already-created bucket):
== BEGIN ~/.asink/config.cfg ==
[core]
storagemethod = s3

[s3]
bucket = <AWS_BUCKET_NAME>
id = <AWS_ID>
host = s3.amazonaws.com
secretkey = <AWS_SECRET_KEY>
https = yes

[server]
host = <HOSTNAME/IP OF ASINK SERVER>
== END ~/.asink/config.cfg ==

Example SSH Configuration (requires server with passwordless SSH logins setup and read/write access to specified directory):
== BEGIN ~/.asink/config.cfg ==
[core]
storagemethod = ssh

[ssh]
host = <SSH SERVER HOSTNAME>
port = 22
username = <SSH USERNAME>
basepath = <PATH IN WHICH ASINK CAN STORE LOTS OF FILES>

[server]
host = <HOSTNAME/IP OF ASINK SERVER>
== END ~/.asink/config.cfg ==

4. To run the Asink client daemon:
$ cd asink/src/client/
$ ./asink start

Notes: Output from the client goes to ~/.asink/asink.log by default. You can run `./asink stop` to stop the client daemon.
