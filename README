What is Asink?
==============

Asink is intended to be yet another Dropbox clone. Why? Well, I didn't like any of the others out there.

It is still very much a work in progress, and I will update this file with more information as development proceeds.


Installation
============

Please see the INSTALL file in this directory for more details.
